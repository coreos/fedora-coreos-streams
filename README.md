# Fedora CoreOS metadata

Official stream and update metadata for Fedora CoreOS. The JSON metadata in this
repo is synced to S3 by
[`sync-stream-metadata`](https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-pipeline/blob/main/jobs/sync-stream-metadata.Jenkinsfile).
The S3 bucket is the canonical source used by all consumers.

These files are updated whenever FCOS releases are made. Each release for each
stream is usually tracked by a GitHub issue on this repo.

Stream metadata is stored in `streams/` and used for example by
[the download page](https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/download/),
[coreos-installer](https://coreos.github.io/coreos-installer/), and many others.
It is a public API provided at a stable URL. It is generated by
[`fedora-coreos-stream-generator`](https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-stream-generator/).
For more information, see
[the documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/stream-metadata/).

Update metadata is stored in `updates/` and used by the
[Cincinnati service](https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-cincinnati/) as
part of building the update graph that the
[Zincati client](https://coreos.github.io/zincati/) queries for update
information. It is a private API.

For more technical information about the metadata, see
[the tracker documentation](https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/tree/main/metadata).
